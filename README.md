# Snake Game

## Overview
This is a simple Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The objective of the game is to control the snake, represented by a series of blocks, to eat the food, represented by a green block, and grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or hits the boundaries of the game window.

## Features
- Classic Snake gameplay.
- Snake grows longer each time it eats the food.
- Random placement of food after the snake eats it.
- Simple controls using arrow keys: Up, Down, Left, Right.

## Screenshots
Here is a screenshot of the Snake game:

## How to Play
1. Run the `snake_game.py` file using Python:
   ```bash
   python snake_game.py
   ```
2. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
3. Guide the snake to eat the green food blocks to grow longer.
4. Avoid running into the walls or colliding with the snake's own body.
5. The game ends when the snake collides, and you can restart by closing and running the script again.

## Controls
- **Up Arrow**: Move the snake up.
- **Down Arrow**: Move the snake down.
- **Left Arrow**: Move the snake left.
- **Right Arrow**: Move the snake right.

## Additional Notes
- The snake's speed increases as it grows longer, making the game more challenging.
- Each time the snake eats the food, its length increases by one block.
- The game window size is 420x420 pixels.
- The snake starts with a single block and grows longer with each food eaten.
- The snake wraps around the screen edges, allowing it to move from one edge to the opposite edge.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Turtle graphics library (included in standard Python library)

## Credits
- This project is inspired by the classic Snake arcade game.
- Developed using Python and the Turtle graphics library.
